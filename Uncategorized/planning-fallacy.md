# Planning Fallacy

### Scratch Notes

Reading this research paper to further improve planning. It says that most ​ software projects are underestimated, ​ only 1/3 are successes (within budget, ​ within estimated time). They proposed an *inside-outside* model of how we plan ​ things. We look at the *inside* the ​ project, the specifics, our team, etc ​ but fail to acknowledge the *outside*. ​ *Outside* includes the other relevant, ​ similar projects that can provide actual​ time of completion. So we need to ​ include more of these *outside* parameters​ when planning a project.

However, my initial thought on this is that, *"Wouldn't it be better to estimate at 4 weeks then finish it at 6 rather than estimate it at 8 and finish it at 8?"* This was debunked by the study saying, *"However, they do not provide conclusive evidence that the earlier predictions actually cause earlier completion times."*

~~I haven't finished the paper, I'm at page Chapter 5.~~ I'm still able to formulate an action point: *Take note of your actual completion time on your tasks.* This will help me keep very useful data on estimating as it's hard to find specific estimates on the internet. For now, I would still use *inside*, dividing tasks into subtasks and reinforce it with *outside* pulled in from my previous data, to properly estimate the subtasks.

I read the paper's conclusion however there isn't really an obvious answer given. I think it's more of, go for the the **third-person perspective** when estimating, and also **focus on the obstacles**. Aside from that, remember to have **a list of actual times for your tasks** so you have a good reference.

### Solutions
The solutions offered can actually be found on the last chapter, Implications for debiasing. To add, he also sent me a more recent paper[^recent-paper] written in 2018, that has discussed more solutions. I find the following approach significant, forming implementation intentions, e.g., *“I intend to write the report in situation X.”*[^implementation-intentions] Here are the other steps we can use to improve our planning:

1. Base on **actual completion times** of similar projects
2. **Focus on potential obstacles** as they're usually underestimated
3. **Decompose** tasks into reasonable segments
4. Apply **third-person perspective**
5. **Backward Planning**

[^implementation-intentions]: Forming implementation intentions led participants to predict earlier completion times, relative to the goal-intention condition, but had an **even greater impact on actual completion times**, and thereby reduced the degree of optimistic bias in prediction.
